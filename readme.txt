LeadSource Tracker is a simple campaign and marketing attribution that tracks multiple lead sources per visitor.


== Description ==

Finally, marketing attribution that won't break the bank!

LeadSource Tracker is a plugin for Wordpress websites which allows you to tag your inbound links (emails, advertisements, newsletters, press releases, even 
offline venues) so that you can find out where your leads and opportunities are coming from and calculate real ROI.

LeadSource Tracker can attribute MULTIPLE lead sources to a visitor when they register.  When the user registers or places an order on your website, all the 
past campaigns that the user has clicked on can be populated into your forms, where they can be stored in your CRM for reports that consist of marketing attribution to multiple campaigns.  You can even retrieve the lead sources and use the campaign information to customize your web pages.



== Installation ==

1. Upload `leadsourcetracker.free.php` to the `/wp-content/plugins/leadsourcetracker` directory (Make the directory first)

2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress

3. Go to Settings->LeadSource Tracker and select the page where the lead sources should be retrieved as GET parameters - this is the page where all your campaign parameters will show up as ldsrc_0 and ldsrc_n, where ldsrc_0 is the first campaign, and ldsrc_n is the last campaign that the visitor came through before registering.

4. Populate ldsrc_0 and/or ldsrc_n into your forms through hidden fields so that they may be stored in your CRM system for reporting.

5. Append ?ldsrc=[Campaign Name] to all your landing pages e.g. www.mywebsite.com/product9/?ldsrc=twitter_ads



== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How do I tag a campaign? =

You can tag any campaign by appending ?ldsrc=[Campaign Name] to any page on your website.  E.g. let's say you have a twitter link into your product page that goes to:  www.mywebsite.com/special_twitter_promo/

To tag the visitor as having come from the special twitter promotion campaign, just enter this as the URL on your tweet:  www.mywebsite.com/special_twitter-
promo/?ldsrc=twitter_promo

As soon as the visitor comes to the landing page through your Tweet, the leadsource "twitter_promo" will be stored in their browser.  Any subsequent campaigns that the visitor comes through will be stored as well.  When the visitor goes to your order / registration page that you specified in Settings->Leadsource Tracker, "twitter_promo", and any subsequent campaigns will be retrieved as GET parameters on that page, which can be easily placed as hidden fields in your registration forms for storage and reporting.



= How do I retrieve the lead sources when the visitor registers / orders? =

The lead source information is stored in your visitor's browser every time they come through a campaign.  To retrieve the lead sources, simply go to Settings->LeadSource Tracker and select the page (usually your order form or registration page) and click save.  This page will retrieve the lead sources 
and populate the URL with GET parameters.  In your contact form, populate hidden fields with the GET parameters that show up in the URL: 

<input type="hidden" name="first_source" value="<?php echo $_GET['ldsrc_0'];?>">
<input type="hidden" name="last_source" value="<?php echo $_GET['ldsrc_n'];?>">

where ldsrc_0 is the first campaign the visitor ever saw,
and ldsrc_n is the last campaign the visitor ever saw.


In the Pro and Enterprise editions, you can retrieve 

the first (ldsrc_0), last (ldsrc_n) and everything in between (ldsrc_1 .. ldsrc_999) for multiple pages on your website.
